          <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
          <li>2 cups milk</li>

          <li>Shredded cheddar cheese, chives, and additional sour cream and bacon for topping</li> 
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Place bacon pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and browned.</li>
          <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>
          <li>Add butter and chopped onion, cook over medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes).</li>
          <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (30 seconds).</li>
          <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth (use whisk if needed).</li>
          <li>Add diced potatoes to the pot along with the chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. Stir well.</li>
          <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes).</li>
          <li>Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender.).</li>
          <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour cream and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.</li>
          <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
          <li>Top with additional sour cream, bacon, cheddar cheese, or chives. Enjoy!</li>
